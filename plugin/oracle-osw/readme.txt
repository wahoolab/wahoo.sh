   Modified: 2/10/2012

Overview

   Oracle OS Watcher (called OS Watcher Black Box as of Feb. 2012) is a great 
   utility which can be downloaded from the Oracle support web site if you 
   have an account. This program will collect OS performance data at regular
   intervals and store them in a series of files. It also comes with a program
   to convert the data into charts.

Install

   Download the OS Watcher tar file (for example oswbb4.0.tar) into the 
   ${WAHOO}/plugin/oracle-osw directory.
