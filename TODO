Need to add command line options to .wahoo-setup.sh so I can run automated tests
without being prompted...do I really want to do this or is this a different test
package that only developers run? Think we need one for all-users and one for
developers.

Create script to download and install a NOSQL DB, and then allow option of
using that as a datastore for cache.sh. Also write other utilities which 
make use of the NOSQL database easy.

Make sure that wahoo.sh setup runs automatically anytime a VERSION change event
is detected and log results or capture results.

Create TiddlyWiki for documentation. Add entry on why I don't like to use
functions. They don't export well, they are not predictable, they are harder
to debug.

At this point there is no validation of a PARAMETER name when you run "wahoo.sh
config". If we allow user defined parms then validation gets a bit complicated
and I almost rather perform no validation of some sort of "soft" validation and
not worry about it. What is "soft" validation? Soft validation probably means
monitoring the parameters and just logging any unknown parameters to the app
log file every now and then. These "INFO" messages should be reviewed 
periodically. One other thing to consider is that the config files can be 
edited manually so that is why we would need some sort of passive monitoring.
The main thing we want to check for is a typo in a delivered parameter.

Add a variable naming format for .wahoo files which will prevent those 
parameters from being over-written the next time "wahoo.sh setup" is run.
