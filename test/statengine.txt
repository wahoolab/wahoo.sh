Can this script trigger events?
-------------------------------
No. The purpose of this script is limited to the following.

   1) Starting and stopping the statengined.sh daemon.
   2) Minor validation and staging of data for statengined.sh

Does this script provide outputs for reporting?
-----------------------------------------------
No.

What outputs does the script provide?
-------------------------------------
This script does not provide any outputs. However, you can direct the
output file for statengined.sh by using the --output-file option.

Will this script provide an API for dumps?
------------------------------------------
There will need to be a way to trigger the daemon to dump all of the 
current data. Will need to think about this feature once I start to
enhance the daemon. The API will need to perhaps ask for a dump level
and also a location for the dump files (there should be a default
location of course and a default dump level.

Will this script provide an API for status or dashboards?
---------------------------------------------------------
Yes. This script should provide a way to determine if the daemon is
running or not. Perhaps it should return the number of hours, minutes
or days that it has been running. Some sort of general log file should
also be available which returns some detail about how long it is
taking to process stats and such.

Will this script write to the application log file?
---------------------------------------------------
Yes. Start and stops are logged to the app log, but need to confirm.

   NOTE: All configuration changes need to be logged to the app log.
   For example, if STATENGINE is changed from 0 to 60, this should 
   be detected and automatically logged in the app log. This feature
   needs to be implemented.

Will this script write to the debug log file?
---------------------------------------------
Debug Level
   1 - Don't think we need anything here, although anything that hits
       the app log might ought to be a level 1 debug.
   2 - Not yet but maybe. Perhaps cat the input file if debug 2 
       is set. Might need to add a debug_level function.

Does this script write to any other logs?
-----------------------------------------
No, but the statengined.sh script will write to statengined.log.

Will the daemon be stopped when wahoo.sh --stop is called?
----------------------------------------------------------
Yes it should, but I need to check on this.

Is there a maximum # of data points which can be passed to this script?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Not yet, but there should be some sort of threshold to limit some sort
of runaway process.
